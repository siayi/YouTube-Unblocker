# NodeJS YouTube Unblocker

A simple YouTube proxy and client for viewing YouTube videos in blocked/restricted networks. Makes use of the `ytdl-core` and `ytsr` npm packages. It is effectively just a wrapper for these packages. 

You can use a running example here:

## Functionality
- Searching for videos
- Streams over connection rather than download
- No ads
- Bypasses firewalls
- Download videos with one click

## Note:
This only *streams* the video. Therefore, skipping and scrubbing in the browser are not supported. Download the video instead if you want to skip/scrub/speed up.
